* ["The Effects of Exercise Training in Addition to Energy Restriction on Functional Capacities and Body Composition in Obese Adults during Weight Loss"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3884087/) - Large meta-analysis of multiple studies, see **Table 6** for a summary of body composition changes across each type, showing that **lean mass decreases with caloric restriction, i.e. eating a deficit necessarily causes muscle loss to some extent**.  Contains supporting evidence for exercise regimens helping reduce the lean tissue loss.

    * ["*Results indicated that exercise modality had no effect on REE.*"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7882110)

* Long-term metabolic activity is not substantially affected by exercise[*"No change in physical activity energy expenditure was found in any of the groups. These results suggest that endurance and resistance training does not chronically alter TEE"*](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jcem.87.3.8282)
