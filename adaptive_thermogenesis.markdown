## Notes on [adaptive thermogenesis](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/567126_2)

This file contains some research notes on the somewhat-controversial subject of whether or not weight loss causes a drop in resting energy expenditure.  Until incorporated into the main notes, everything here should be taken as the stream of consciousness that it is.

[*"REE predictions were not different than REE-m, but agreements were better with HB and MSJ, particularly in the GB and LE groups."*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383286/) - post-gastric bypass (GB) patients with >10kg loss did not show deviation from MSJ (although the omission of the obese group may suggest MSJ is less accurate on *that* end of the process)

[*"Changes in FM and FFM explained 76.5% and 79.3% of the variance seen in absolute resting EE at baseline and post-weight loss, respectively...This analysis does not support the notion of a greater than predicted decrease in resting EE after weight loss."*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22327054/) - **large** (N=1450) systematic review with some author overlap from the previous article.
